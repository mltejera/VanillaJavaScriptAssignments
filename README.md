A repository of assignments from Lynda.com to learn Vanilla Javascript.

<b>Vanilla JS Binding and Propogation</b>
In this project, I used pure Javascript to build a simple card flipper. With no layout html, Javascript was used to construct the elements, apply styles, execute logic and perform animations. The end result was a simple flash card flipping app. All the heavy lifting was done in Main.js while the .css, .html and .json files were provided.
