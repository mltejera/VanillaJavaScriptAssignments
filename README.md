# Vanilla JavaScript Projects
A repository of projects to learn Vanilla JavaScript.

<b>Vanilla JS Binding and Propogation</b>
In this project, I used pure JavaScript to build a simple card flipper. With no layout html, JavaScript was used to construct the elements, apply styles, execute logic and perform animations. The end result was a simple flash card flipping app. All the heavy lifting was done in Main.js while the .css, .html and .json came from templates.

<b>Working With Ajax Requests</b>
Ajax requests are fundemental to the way data gets transfered on the web. In the project, I explored the variuos ways to handle Ajax requests, starting with Vanilla JavaScript, then using other techniques, such as fetch, Angular and React. All my work was done in  js/script2.js, and all html and css was provided from templates.
