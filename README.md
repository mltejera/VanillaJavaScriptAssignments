# VanillaJavaScriptAssignments
A repository of assignments from Lynda.com to learn Vanilla Javascript.

<b>Vanilla JS Binding and Propogation</b>
In this project, I used pure Javascript to build a simple card flipper. With no layout html, Javascript was used to construct the elements, apply styles, execute logic and perform animations. The end result was a simple flash card flipping app. All the heavy lifting was done in Main.js while the .css, .html and .json files were part of the provided excercise files.

<b>Working With Ajax Requests</b>
Ajax requests are fundemental to the way data gets transfered via the web. In the project, we explore the variuos ways to handle Ajax requests, starting with vanilla javascript, then using other techniques, such as fetch, Angular and React. All my work was done in  js/script2.js, and all html and css was provided as part of the exercise.
